            <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 pound mascarpone cheese, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1/4 cup strong brewed coffee, at room temperature</li>

            <li>Whisk egg yolks and sugar together in a medium saucepan until well blended.</li>
            <li>Whisk in milk and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil.</li>
            <li>Boil gently for 1 minute, then remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Cover tightly and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Beat cream and vanilla in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Remove egg yolk mixture from the refrigerator; add mascarpone cheese and whisk until smooth.</li>
            <li>Combine coffee and rum in a small bowl. Split ladyfingers in half lengthwise and drizzle with the coffee mixture. Arrange 1/2 of the soaked ladyfingers in the bottom of a 7x11-inch dish.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/2 of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers, then spread 1/2 of the whipped cream over top. Repeat layers once more.</li>
